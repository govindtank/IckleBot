##About

**IckleBot** facilitates quick Android development by generating boilerplate code in 
`Activity` instances and offers an alternative simplified threading model. It encourages 
loose-coupling and maintainability by providing a runtime [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) 
framework.   
   
Annotation based Android development with...
   
* Dependency Injection   
	1. Layouts
	2. Resources
	3. System Services
	4. Application Instances
	5. POJOs   
<br/>
* An alternative threading model which simplifies the execution of worker threads and 
UI tasks.   

* Activity state management and configuration of window features.

##Setup

### 1. For Maven Based Android Projects

Add the following dependency in your project's pom.xml.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.lonepulse</groupId>
   <artifactId>icklebot</artifactId>
   <version>1.1.1</version>
   <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```

For information on building Android projects using Maven here's [Chapter 14](http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/android-dev.html) of `Maven: The Complete Reference`.   
<br/>   

### 2. For Standard Android Projects

Clone the repository and import it as an **existing project** in Eclipse.

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/sahan/IckleBot.git
```

Since the Eclipse metadata is maintained in the repository, the project should be immediately available as an Android library which you can reference in your own project. Refer the [developer guide](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject) for information on referencing library projects.
